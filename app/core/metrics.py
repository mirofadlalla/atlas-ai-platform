RAG-specific metrics collection module.

This module defines custom Prometheus metrics for RAG pipeline monitoring.
These metrics complement the system metrics in monitors.py and provide
RAG-specific visibility into pipeline performance and efficiency.

Metrics are automatically collected and pushed to Prometheus for visualization
in Grafana dashboards.
